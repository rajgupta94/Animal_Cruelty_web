A webpage against animal cruelty that we ([Dharmisht](https://github.com/dragn0id), [Dhyaan](https://github.com/Dhyaan1), [Hrishik](https://github.com/fringewidth), and [Kusha](https://github.com/silver-shadow)) hacked together in four hours for an inter-collegiate front-end website building competiton, and won :)

Uniquely, the website encourages users to reconsider everyday practices they often take for granted, through interactive elements that explore:

- The plight of stray animals
- The realities behind animal consumption
- The hidden horrors of using animal skins in fashion

These interactive features were written in React and good ol' Vanilla CSS. We also used Tailwind, ShadCN and FramerMotion to provide a nice UI that ties everything together.
We also provided some features to adopt pets from shelters and donate to prevent animal cruelty that currently link to real animal-cruelty causes.
